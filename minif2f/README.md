# MiniF2F

## More coming soon...
We have released our validation set, which was used to obtain the results reported in our [second blog post](https://www.harmonic.fun/news#blog-post-2-link). We are planning on releasing the train and test set soon.

## Our Improvements to MiniF2F
To accurately assess our system's capabilities, we have made several improvements to MiniF2F:

1. We translated the problem statements to Lean 4, the leading system for formal mathematics today
2. We re-split the 488 problems uniformly randomly into a training set of 390 problems, a validation set of 48 problems, and a test set of 50 problems. 4
3. We ensured that each formal statement is associated with an accurate natural-language statement, allowing us to evaluate autoformalization capabilities.
4. We fixed many incorrect formalizations, including several theorem statements that became trivial or impossible in their original Lean encodings 5

Our work builds upon We began with formal statements released by the [Hoskinson Center](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hoskinson-center/minif2f-lean4), themselves derived from [Facebook Researchâ€™s fork](https://github.com/facebookresearch/miniF2F) which fixed several issues with the [original benchmark](https://github.com/openai/miniF2).

## MiniF2F

MiniF2F is a formal mathematics benchmark (translated across multiple formal systems) consisting of
exercise statements from olympiads (AMC, AIME, IMO) as well as high-school and undergraduate maths
classes.

The goal of the project is to provide a shared benchmark to evaluate and directly compare automated
theorem proving systems based on the formal systems targeted, initially **Lean**, and **Metamath**
(targeting also **Hol Light** and **Isabelle**).

The benchmark (released under permissive licenses (MIT for Metamath, Apache for Lean)) is a work in
progress and contributions are welcome and encouraged through pull requests.
